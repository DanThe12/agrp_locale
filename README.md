Translations for Asshat Gaming's GTACRP servers

## Want to provide a translation?
Here's some info about how it works:
* You can either submit a pull request with your changes, or send me the file over DM each time and I'll add them in.

* There's no rush. You can translate at your own pace, and **you don't need to translate it all right away**. There's nothing *missing* from an incomplete translation. There's no errors or any worries, and anything that hasn't been translated yet will show up as English.

* You *can* move around the `{1}`, `{2}`, etc but **please don't delete them**. The server replaces these in real-time with info from the script. Usually names of things (like vehicle or player names), and sometimes commands, i.e. /login

* **All new strings will be added to the bottom of the file**, including any that previously translated but were changed (usually for bug fix or if a server mechanic gets changed). This makes it easy to find the latest stuff that needs translated.

* The first two items aren't translated. They just provide a reference to the name and author of the translation.

* Some strings say `DO NOT TRANSLATE` .. these are just comment lines, usually to separate new sections when I add a bunch of strings in bulk. Most of them will have a date for when it was addded. JSON doesn't have a comment system so I had to resort to this method. Please don't translate these.
